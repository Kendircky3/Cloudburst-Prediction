# Cloudburst Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning‚Äìbased predictive model to identify potential cloudburst events in urban areas within a short (3‚Äì6 hour) time window. The work includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, with a focus on addressing class imbalance and improving early warning capabilities.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ `Miami.ipynb`  
This notebook contains the **initial data processing and cleaning** steps. It focuses on loading and transforming NOAA weather station data from Miami, including:
- Removing duplicates and outliers  
- Handling missing values  
- Extracting and engineering features such as lagged precipitation, weather indicators, and temporal encodings  

### üìÅ `Improving cloudburst prediction.ipynb`  
This notebook documents the **final machine learning modeling process**, including:
- Applying SMOTEENN for class balancing  
- Training multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Two-Stage Model)  
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC  
- Final model selection based on predictive reliability and practicality  

### üìÅ `final_report.pdf`  
A comprehensive **project summary and reflection**, including:
- Problem statement and goals  
- Literature review and methodology  
- Data and model performance analysis  
- Ethical considerations and future directions  
- Personal learning reflections
